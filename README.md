# Description
This is a simple TicTacToe game made in C++ using [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) to draw on the screen the game.

In the future, it would be great to add lan multiplayer.

# Contributing
It is one of my first projects using C++ and sfml so it's not the best code possible by any means, if you want to help me improve the code feel free to create Pull Requests for any changes that you think the code could benefit from.
